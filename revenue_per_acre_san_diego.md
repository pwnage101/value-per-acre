# [DRAFT] San Diego County: Tax Revenue Per Acre

These represent the tax revenue (tax rate * property assessment value) per acre
of each urban parcel.  Tax rates are determined on a parcel-by-parcel basis by
joining the parcel data together with [Tax Rate Area (TRA) data](https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/auditor/trb2021/tralist.pdf).

This is still a work in progress---more data needs to be cleaned up.  For
instance, several parcels share identical geometries when the owner is
leasing subdivisions of the parcel to other entities (e.g. UCSD leasing a lot
on campus to Target), which currently show up as zero.
