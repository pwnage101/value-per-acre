# Value-per-acre analyses

Many cities in the US are in debt; in 2021, San Diego had a debt burden of $2.1
billion, and Sacramento's was $607.5 million according to [Truth In
Accounting's (TIA) 2021
report](https://www.truthinaccounting.org/news/detail/financial-state-of-the-cities-2021).
Year over year cities like San Diego sink deeper into debt---there
isn't enough tax revenue to turn the situation around.

While unpaid retirement benefits may be the largest single driver of debt,
there are many other smaller services that the city offers which come with
their own liabilities, and when combined make up a significant portion of the
overall debt.  Some of these municipal services may include sewage, other
utilities, public safety, and roads/highways.  In one case, the [city of Remer, MN was
forced to look to grants and loans to replace 300ft of leaking
pipe](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2019/7/1/my-journey-from-free-market-ideologue-to-strong-towns-advocate),
which it wouldn't otherwise be able to afford, thus creating more debt.

Many of these infrastructure-related services share a common trait: their scale
is influenced by urban design, especially urban sprawl.  My goal with these
Value-per-acre analyses is to better understand which existing development
patterns are more or less financially solvent for a city by plotting the tax
value per lot area of taxable parcels in different neighborhoods for
comparison.
